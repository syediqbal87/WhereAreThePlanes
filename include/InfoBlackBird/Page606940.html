	<!-- Description -->
	<!-- Source: https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/m-21.php -->
	<p>The M-21 is one of the few projects at the Skunk Works that was relatively unsuccessful. The M-21 is an A-12-like aircraft designed to launch the once ultra-secret D-21 Drone. When the United States signed a treaty to end flights of manned vehicles over the Soviet Union, an unmanned vehicle was needed for reconnaissance. Since the A-12 is an overflight vehicle, it would undermine the treaty if used in the future. Consequently, after A-12 #60-6939 was built, two aircraft called M-21s were built for the TAGBOARD program. There were two M-21 aircraft built, 60-6940 and 60-6941. Aircraft #60-6941 crashed when the aircraft collided with a D-21 during the launch. This crash ended all M-21 sorties. Later on, the B-52H was used to launch the D-21 drone. The M-21 on Display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA and is the sole surviving example of its type.<a href="https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/m-21.php" target="_blank">[1]</a><p>

	<!-- Crash -->
	<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px">60-6941 (M-21) Crash</h1>
	<p>During a flight test on 30 July 1966 for launching the drone, the drone pitched down and struck the 60-6941 (M-21), breaking it in half. Pilot Bill Park and Launch Control Officer (LCO) Ray Torick stayed with the plane a short time before ejecting over the Pacific Ocean. Both made safe ejections, but Ray Torick opened his helmet visor by mistake and his suit filled up with water which caused him to drown. This terrible personal and professional loss resulted in "Kelly" Johnson's decision to cancel the M-21/D-21 program.<a href="http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/M21_Crash.htm" target="_blank">[2]</a><p>
